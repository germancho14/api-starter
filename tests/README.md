## Tests

This folder holds test scripts and results 

The `test.sh` bash script is a simple way to run requests against a target service using curl. This is not *testing* as in TDD/BDD but is does at least give you feedback on simple actions.

I recommend using Postman (postman.com) to build up a robust test suite for your APIs.
